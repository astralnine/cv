         <p>Alice in Chains both epitomized the solemn,
         heavy Seattle sound of the 1990s and stood
         apart from the grunge hordes. What separated
         Alice in Chains from their alt-rock brethren
         was how their roots lay in heavy metal, not
         punk. Guitarist Jerry Cantrell and vocalist
         Layne Staley both played in metal bands prior
         to the formation of Alice in Chains in 1987 and
         they released the band's debut, Facelift, in 1990,
         well before Nirvana's Nevermind pushed the underground
         into the mainstream. Despite their connections to
         metal, Alice in Chains thrived in the glory days
         of grunge, and it wasn't merely a question of
         timing, either. The band's sensibility fit into t
         he alternative rock zeitgeist of the early '90s.</p>
         <p>Alice in Chains became one of the first alt-rock bands
         of the '90s to delve into acoustic-based music, scoring
         hits with the comparatively softer "No Excuses" and
         "I Stay Away." Despite its success, the band was plagued
         with internal tensions during its commercial peak, much of
         it stemming from Staley's drug addictions. His abuse slowed
         the band's upward trajectory in the back half of the '90s,
         a descent culminating in the singer's accidental death in
         2002. Four years later, Cantrell, drummer Sean Kinney,
         and bassist Mike Inez revived Alice in Chains with singer
         William DuVall, sparking an extended second life of recording
         and touring that has lasted longer than their original incarnation.
